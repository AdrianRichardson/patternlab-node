I’ve done [my survey](https://survey.piccalil.li/), so I feel like I can now answer the questions that I set out in [part 1 of the design discovery posts](https://deploy-preview-14--optimistic-euler-81121a.netlify.com/journal/005-design-discovery-part-1-%E2%80%94-user-research/).

## What is the purpose of Piccalilli?

The purpose of Piccalilli is to provide folks with a source of inspiration and learning material for my favourite language on the web: CSS. The long-term goal is for there to be a huge archive of resources that I’ve hand-picked or created for people to use, permanently.

## How many users are interacting with it, currently?

The current count of subscribers at the time of writing is **1200**, with an average open rate of **75%**. When passing traffic to the site is accounted for, each issue probably currently gets around **2000** people’s eyes on it. 

## What are the most common friction points within the current product?

* The current platform doesn’t make managing content very easy for me
* I have no actual ownership of the content because Curated could just disappear one day
* The issues and site in general are currently inaccessible 
* Images are not as optimised as they could be and no facility alt text is provided

## How is Piccalilli’s performance currently measured?

The performance is currently measured with Curated’s analytics, which measures subscription count, un-subscription count and general stats about issues such as open rate, clicks and individual link clicks. 

The only performance I’m interested in moving forward is:

* How many subscribers I have
* How many emails arrived successfully 
* How the site continues to perform (perf, perf budget, accessibility) 

## Do users struggle to sign up or read each issue?

Folks without disabilities appear to have no major issues signing up or reading each issue. I can’t 100% speak for folks that do have disabilities, but it’s safe to presume that their experience on the site and in their email client is suboptimal because of the accessibility issues.
