I plan _obsessively_ and this project is no different to proper client work. I really like using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) because it gives me total flexibility, but importantly, [Trello](https://trello.com)-style boards.

This is what the board for this project looks like so far:

![A Notion board with kanban columns and lots of cards in the backlog](https://res.cloudinary.com/andybelldesign/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto,w_1000/v1558039593/piccalilli%20journal/Screenshot_2019-05-16_at_21.28.56_faxgw8.jpg)

This board will grow and grow as time goes on with this project. It’s important that it does, too, because if I don’t plan it like this, working in a piecemeal fashion—as is often the case with side-projects, will be near-enough impossible.
