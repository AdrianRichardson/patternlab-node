# Pattern Lab

This monorepo contains the core of Pattern Lab / Node and all related engines, UI kits, plugins and utilities. Pattern Lab helps you and your team build thoughtful, pattern-driven user interfaces using atomic design principles.

If you'd like to see what a front-end project built with Pattern Lab looks like, check out this [online demo of Pattern Lab output](http://demo.patternlab.io/).

## Using Pattern Lab

Refer to the [core usage guidelines](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/blob/master/packages/core/README.md#usage)

### Installation

Installation is still in flux due to the monorepo transition. Bear with us as we figure this out. Our intent is to ship the Pattern Lab Node CLI soon which will help new and existing users.

_In the meantime..._

if you already have an Edition tracking 3.X alphas, you can update using the [standard instructions](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Upgrading#3x-instructions).

if you don't mind pulling down everything and playing with it locally, clone this repo and follow the instructions for [developing locally](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#developing-locally).

if you don't yet have a 3.X compatible Edition and want to try something a bit messier (and unsupported for now), you could attempt this [workaround](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/issues/813).

## Ecosystem

![Pattern Lab Ecosystem](http://patternlab.io/assets/pattern-lab-2-image_18-large-opt.png)

Core, and Editions, are part of the [Pattern Lab Ecosystem](http://patternlab.io/docs/advanced-ecosystem-overview.html). With this architecture, we encourage people to write and maintain their own Editions, Starterkits, and even PatternEngines.

## Support for Pattern Lab

Pattern Lab / Node wouldn't be what it is today without the support of the community. It will always be free and open source. Continued development is made possible in part from the support of [these wonderful project supporters](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Thanks). If you want to learn more about supporting the project, visit the [Pattern Lab / Node Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/patternlab).
